> ** The Problem of the Random Walk **
> Can any of your readers refer me to a work wherein I should find a solution of the following problem, or failing the knowledge of any existing solution provide me with an original one? I should be extremely grateful for aid in the matter.
> A man starts from a point O and walks _l_ yards in a straight line; he then turns at any angle whatever and walks another _l_ yards in a second straight line. he repeats this process _n_ times. I require the probability that after these _n_ stretches he is at a distance between _r_ and _r + delta-r_ from his starting point, O.
> The problem is one of considerable interest, but I have only succeeded in obtaining an integrated solution for _two_ stretches. I think, however, that a solution ought to be found, if only in the form of a series in powers of 1/_n_, where _n_ is large.
