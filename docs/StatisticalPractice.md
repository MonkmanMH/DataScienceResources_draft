# Statistical & Data Science Practice

First, an excellent list of data science resources:

* [Practical Data Science for Stats - a PeerJ Collection](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/)


### Introduction

How does one approach a statistics or data science project?

#### The function of data science: solving business problems

Emily Robinson, 2017-09-27, [Managing Business Challenges In Data Science](https://robinsones.github.io/Managing-Business-Challenges-in-Data-Science/)


#### Opinionated Analysis Development

An over-arching structure of what a project could (or should?) look like can be boiled down into three features: it is

1. Reproducible and auditable

2. Accurate

3. Collaborative


* Hilary Parker, 2017-08-30, [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)

  - some of Hilary Parker's earlier / supporting thoughts on this topic can be found in [her talk "Opinionated Analysis Development" from rstudio::conf2017 (2017-01-14)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/opinionated-analysis-development/) ([slides alone at slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/opinionated-analysis-development)), as well as the slides from her [keynote at EARL SF (2017-06-15)](https://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/opinionated-analysis-development-earl-sf-keynote)



#### General practice and workflow

* Gabe Becker (2017) [Enhancing reproducibility, comparability and discoverability of results in multi-analyst settings](https://www.slideshare.net/GabrielBecker11/enhancing-reproducibility-comparability-and-discoverability-of-results-in-multianalyst-settings), presentation at EARL (Enterprise Applications of R Language), San Francisco, June 5-7, 2017

  -- this came to my attention via the Not So Standard Deviations podcast, [episode 40 "It's the CDs All Over Again"](https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-40-its-11713845) (2017-06-13). The discussion of Gabe Becker's presentation begins at ~13' 10".
  
  - some of Hilary Parker's observations: the topic doesn't get much air time, his talk takes wide view of issues in an organization, trade-offs in collaborative environment (not one analyst); in multi-analyst system (e.g. where both a researcher/biologist and a statistician are both working with the same data) have to reconcile results, there might be parallel studies where results need to be reconciled, >> this creates a need for the data to be created in similar environments. 
  
  - Concerns: reproducibity, comparability,  discoverability (finding the results), and empowerment. Data scientists skew to emppowerment!  But the concerns are in tension--you can increase reproducibility but at cost of empowerment, etc.
  
  - "Most organizations aren't making that judgement call ahead of time...any organization ... if data scientists were there early, you're going to be skewed to agility and high empowerment. Because that's like what we want! ... Data scientists are allergic to process...having any template for results, or ... even having to put things into a specific tool."
  
  - Different systems need different constraints.
  
  - Roger Peng: most organizations don't realize that they are explicitly making these trade-offs, can't maximize all. Have to make a choice, and that's very unsatisfactory for people.

### Coding practice

[Coding etiquette](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/04/25/etiquette.html), a guide to writing clear, informative and easy-to-use #RStats code by @CodingClub 


#### Literate programming

The practice of explaining the program logic in a natural language"; it goes beyond what might be called "documentation". In the world of R, the RMarkdown functionality within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), including [R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html), is a way to program in this manner.

The concept was introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984; the original article is
