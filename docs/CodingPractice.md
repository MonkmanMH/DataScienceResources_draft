### Theory and methods

#### Literate programming

The practice of explaining the program logic in a natural language"; it goes beyond what might be called "documentation". In the world of R, the RMarkdown functionality within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), including [R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html), is a way to program in this manner.

The concept was introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984; the original article is
> Knuth, Donald E. (1984). ["Literate Programming"](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf) (PDF). _The Computer Journal_. British Computer Society. 27 (2): 97–111.
