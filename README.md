# DataScienceResources

An attempt to create a handy compendium of resources that cover data science (a.k.a. statistics, econometrics, actuarial science, etc.) topics. These will cover general theory, applications, and R methods (often, all in a single entry).

The topics thus far:

* Gini coefficient

* Quantile regression

* Seasonal adjustment
