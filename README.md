# DataScienceResources

An attempt to create a handy compendium of resources that cover data science (a.k.a. statistics, econometrics, actuarial science, etc.) topics. These will cover general theory, applications, and R methods (often, all in a single entry).

The topics thus far:

* [Gini coefficient](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/GiniCoefficient.md)

* [Quantile regression](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/QuantileRegression.md)

* [Seasonal adjustment](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/SeasonalAdjustment.md)
