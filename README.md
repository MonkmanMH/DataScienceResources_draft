# DataScienceResources

A rough compendium of resources that cover data science topics (a.k.a. statistics, econometrics, actuarial science, etc.). These will cover general theory, methodology, applications, and R tools and methods. The emphasis will be on web resources.

## Contents

The topics thus far:

* [Gini coefficient](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/GiniCoefficient.md)

* [Population pyramids](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/PopulationPyramids.md)

* [Quantile regression](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/QuantileRegression.md)

* [Raking](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/Raking.md)

* [Seasonal adjustment](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/SeasonalAdjustment.md)
 

### Creating maps

Thus far, only one page with resources on how to create a choropleth map in R. As I go further down this path, this may dissaggregate into more precisely defined topics.

* [Choropleth maps](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/ChoroplethMaps.md)
