# DataScienceResources

A rough compendium of resources that cover data science topics (a.k.a. statistics, econometrics, actuarial science, etc.). These will cover general theory, methodology, applications, and R tools and methods. The listing is not intended to be comprehensive, but will be resources I find as part of my projects or random happenstance. The emphasis will be on web resources, although published texts will also be included where appropriate.

### Anonymity and confidentiality of individual (personal) data

Protecting the anonymity and confidentiality of individuals (whether the data are from administrative records or surveys) is essential.

The methods associated with this protection are sometimes refered to by the umbrella topics of "statistical disclosure control" and "data masking".

* [Mapping with R -- a list of tutorials and examples](docs/http://spatial.ly/r/)

* [Spatial data](docs/SpatialData.md)


### Communicating about numbers

You've done a cracker-jack job with your statistics, and made some bang-up charts, graphs, and other visualizations. Now how do you tell the world? 

* [Writing in general](docs/Writing.md)

* [Writing about numbers]

* [Data tables](docs/Data_Tables.md)
