# DataScienceResources

A rough compendium of resources that cover data science topics (a.k.a. statistics, econometrics, actuarial science, etc.). These will cover general theory, methodology, applications, and R tools and methods. The emphasis will be on web resources, although published texts will also be included where appropriate.

### Anonymity and confidentiality of individual (personal) data

Protecting the anonymity and confidentiality of individuals (whether the data are from administrative records or surveys) is essential.

### Communicating about numbers

You've done a cracker-jack job with your statistics, and made some bang-up charts, graphs, and other visualizations. Now how do you tell the world? 

* [Writing in general](https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources/blob/master/Writing.md)
