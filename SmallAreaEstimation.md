# Small Area Estimation

### Introduction

Small area estimation (SAE) is an umbrella term to describe a number of approaches that provide "reliable small area statistics even when only very small samples are available for these areas." (Pfeffermann, 2002)

Many of these approaches are based upon Bayesian hierarchical models (see Gómez-Rubio et al. as one example).
